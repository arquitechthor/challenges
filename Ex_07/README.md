**Task**
We use the integers a, b, and n to create the following series:

`(a + 2^0*b),(a + 2^0*b + 2^1*b),..., (a + 2^0*b + 2^1*b + ... + 2^n-1*b)`

You are given _q_ queries in the form of a, b, and n. For each query, print the series corresponding to the given a, b, and n values as a single line of n space-separated integers.

Input Format

The first line contains an integer, _q_, denoting the number of queries.
Each line _i_ of the _q_ subsequent lines contains three space-separated integers describing the respective a, b, and n values for that query.

Output Format

For each query, print the corresponding series on a new line. Each series must be printed in order as a single line of n space-separated integers.
